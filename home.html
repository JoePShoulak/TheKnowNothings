    <p>
        Welcome to The Know Nothings website.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Know Nothings is an organization that is dedicated to the pursuit of improving the overall experience of playing Star Citizen. We are focused primarily on mentorship, mining, cargo hauling, and exploration gameplay, however we also won’t limit ourselves to just these activities, and we look to our community members to share new and creative ways to enjoy the game.
        <br />
        <br />
        We welcome seasoned and new players alike. We provide a friendly and welcoming atmosphere where players can come, share knowledge, experiences, and encourage others to join in the fun.
        <br />
        <br />
        For those who are new to the game, we especially want this to be a place where you can learn about the game from those with a little more experience. Your questions, no matter how basic, will be addressed and answered.
        <br />
        <br />
        For our experienced players we encourage you to serve as a mentor and take new players into the game and show them the ropes.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are a casual organization - that does not mean we are not dedicated to providing consistent and dependable opportunities for you to play - it means we focus on the fun and try not to turn the act of playing a game into a tedious obligation that you have to partake in. We believe Star Citizen isn’t an escape from reality, it’s an enhancement of who you are as a real person.
